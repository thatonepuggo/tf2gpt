# epic rcon ai thing!!
lets people in source games run ";ask" to ask an ai a question.

# how to run
install the dependencies: `pip install`

add the following to your launch options:
```
-condebug -conclearlog -usercon -g15
```

then, add these lines to your `cfg/autoexec.cfg`:
```js
ip 0.0.0.0
rcon_password dontcarelol // edit this if you want
net_start
```

you dont have to edit the rcon_password since the port for rcon likely isnt open, but if you do, edit `main.py` and change the PASSWORD variable to reflect that change.

if you do not already have a replicate account, you can make one by going to this link: https://replicate.com

change the .env_example file to include your discord bot token and your replicate api token.
rename .env_example to .env

in main.py, you can edit the prompt to your liking or you can leave it the same as it is.
